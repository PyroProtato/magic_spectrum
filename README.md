# ðŸª„WELCOME TO MAGIC SPECTRUMðŸª„
## A game by PyroProtato for the Hack Club Game Jam using Python and PyGame

Magic Spectrum is a game where you play as a wizard that battles enemies to restore color to the world! Different color enemies will spawn with different stats, and after defeating a certain amount of them by using magic spells, their color will be restored to the map. 

This game was created for the Hack Club Game Jam hosted by Evan Gan. I built it using python and pygame, as well as pygbag to compress it into an HTML file to be played in the browser. This project consists of around 4500 lines of code and cumulatively took me around 95 hours (and counting!) so I would appreciate any support. I'm tired lol. A lot of youtube videos were watched while I worked on this -_-. (UPDATE): I actually did do well in the Hack Club Game Jam (yay 200 doubloons!) and I was also able to repurpose it for my school's game jam, where I did well in as well! Thank you all for helping so much!

Note: I'm sorry for the kinda scuffed sound quality; it's not my fault I don't think! I made this game in python and used pygbag to make it playable on the web, but while it sounds good in VS code, on the web it doesn't really. I think maybe the songs compressed too much or maybe the web is too laggy? I honestly have no clue. Sorry again!

## ðŸŸ¢Tips and TricksðŸŸ¢
Every time that an enemy of a certain color is defeated, you unlock a new upgrade in the shop and a new magic spell to use. Different color enemies have different stats. Purchasing from the shop upgrades your main stats, which in turn makes your spells more powerful! Also, each spell has different quirks and uses! Check them out under the spell info tab. To win, survive past round 26 and color the world of magic!
